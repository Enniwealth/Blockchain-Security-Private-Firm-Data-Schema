  "finding_title": "ETH withdrawn is sent to msg.sender instead of the to address",
  "finding_description": "In the AccountSpot contract, the `_withdraw` function does not use the `to` address as the recipient of the withdrawn funds in the case of an ETH withdrawal but instead uses `msg.sender` as the recipient. This removes the ability of the withdrawer to specify a different address to receive the funds and, what is more, can lead to the loss of funds if the caller is expecting the funds to be sent to the `to` address, as the NatSpec comment explicitly states that the `to` address is the recipient of the withdrawn funds.",
  "attack_scenario": "A user or contract calls the `_withdraw` function and specifies a custom recipient address in the `to` parameter (e.g., a cold wallet or a relayer contract). However, when withdrawing native ETH (`assetAddresses[i] == address(0)`), the function sends the ETH to `msg.sender` instead of the specified `to` address. This violates the documented behavior, potentially causing the calling contract to hold unexpected funds or the user to lose track of the assets if they were expecting them at the specified `to` address.",
  "fix_description": "Use the `to` address as the recipient of the withdrawn funds in the case of an ETH withdrawal. Change the vulnerable line from `payable(msg.sender).call{value: assetAmounts[i]}(\"\")` to `payable(to).call{value: assetAmounts[i]}(\"\")`. If the expected behavior is that funds can only be withdrawn to the caller, add a condition to check that `to == msg.sender` and revert otherwise.",

The reward amount is calculated based on the fake pool's high rate, and this high amount of the valuable token is transferred to the recipient, effectively stealing funds from the contract's overall balance.",

This allows a malicious actor to deposit a worthless token while increasing the reward rate for the pool's legitimate reward token.",

An attacker calls `incentivizeRecurPool` for this pool, providing a large `incentiveAmount` and setting `incentiveToken` to a worthless token (e.g., AttackerToken).\n3. The reward rate for the WETH pool is updated based on the large amount.\n4. The function executes a `safeTransferFrom` of the worthless AttackerToken, which successfully transfers the token to the contract.\n5. Legitimate users see a high reward rate for WETH, but when they try to claim, the contract quickly runs out of WETH (the actual reward token), or the pool accounting is permanently ruined because the reward token stored in the contract is useless (AttackerToken) but the promised reward is WETH.",

  "finding_description": "In `incentivizeRecurPool`, when adding a new incentive while the current reward period (`periodFinish`) is still active, the new reward rate (`newRewardRate`) is calculated and then assigned directly to `state.rewardRate` instead of being added to the existing `state.rewardRate`. This overwrites and effectively removes the previous incentive provider's reward rate, causing their provided reward amount to be lost/unclaimable.",
  "attack_scenario": "1. User A provides an incentive for 30 days, setting a high `state.rewardRate`.\n2. Before the 30 days are up, User B calls `incentivizeRecurPool` with a new, smaller incentive amount.\n3. The code calculates the `newRewardRate` based only on User B's incentive and the remaining duration.\n4. This calculated `newRewardRate` (B) is assigned to `state.rewardRate`, overwriting the previous, higher `state.rewardRate` (A).\n5. LPs who staked for User A's incentive will receive significantly fewer rewards than promised for the remainder of the period, as the reward rate has been artificially lowered by the overwrite. User A's funds are essentially locked or permanently lost due to the incorrect accounting.",
  "fix_description": "When the current period is still active (`block.timestamp < periodFinish`), the calculated `newRewardRate` (based on the new deposit) must be added to the existing `state.rewardRate`.

  "finding_description": "The `joinRecurPool` function incorrectly increments `userPoolCounts[msgSender][key.stakeToken]` even when the user is only updating their staked balance (i.e., not the first time joining the pool). Since `userPoolCounts` is designed to track the number of distinct pools a user has joined for a specific stake token, its inflation will prevent users from successfully calling the unlock mechanism (which relies on this counter decreasing to zero for the final unlock), leading to a permanent denial of unstake for the affected tokens.",
  "attack_scenario": "1. User A joins a Recur Pool (Pool 1) with Stake Token X. `userPoolCounts[A][X]` becomes 1.\n2. User A later increases their balance of Stake Token X and calls `joinRecurPool` again for Pool 1 (to update their staked amount).\n3. The code incorrectly executes `++userPoolCounts[A][X]`, making the counter 2.\n4. When User A exits all pools, the unlock function will attempt to decrement this counter, but it will never reach zero, permanently locking User A's Stake Token X.",
  "fix_description": "Increment `userPoolCounts` only if the previous staked balance (`stakedBalance`) was zero, indicating the user is joining the pool for the first time. Add a check: `if (stakedBalance == 0) { ++userPoolCounts[msgSender][key.stakeToken]; }`.",

  "finding_title": "depositIncentive and incentivizeRecurPool do not verify if the incentiveToken exists",
  "finding_description": "Both `depositIncentive` (for RushPools) and `incentivizeRecurPool` (for RecurPools) use a version of Solady's `safeTransferFrom2` which does not check the code size of the `incentiveToken` address before performing the transfer call. In Solidity's assembly, if there is no return data (which happens when calling a non-contract address), the call is treated as successful. This allows an attacker to provide a non-contract address as the `incentiveToken` and proceed with updating the reward accounting state without actually transferring any tokens, or use a predictable address of a token that is yet to be created.",
  "attack_scenario": "1. An attacker determines the predictable future address of a legitimate Bunni LP token (Token X).\n2. The attacker calls `incentivizeRecurPool`, using the address of the uncreated Token X and providing a huge fake `incentiveAmount`.\n3. The `safeTransferFrom2` call to the uncreated address is treated as successful due to the lack of code size check, and no actual tokens are transferred to the protocol.\n4. The reward accounting state is updated based on the huge fake incentive, immediately disrupting the pool's reward rate and potentially leading to a permanent locking of real rewards deposited later.",
  "fix_description": "Upgrade the protocol to use the latest version of Solady's SafeTransferLib, which includes a code size check for contract addresses during transfers, or manually implement a code size check (`address(incentiveToken).code.length > 0`) before initiating the transfer.",

  "finding_title": "DOS Attack in joinRushPool",
  "finding_description": "The `joinRushPool` function allows users to stake tokens up to a maximum cap. However, the lack of time restrictions (such as a minimum stake duration or an unstaking delay) allows malicious actors to perform a sandwich attack, repeatedly front-running and back-running legitimate users' stake transactions to keep the pool permanently full.",
  "attack_scenario": "1. Attacker observes a pending transaction where a legitimate user attempts to call `joinRushPool`.\n2. **Front-run:** Attacker calls `joinRushPool` to fill the pool up to its stake cap.\n3. Victim's transaction fails because the pool capacity is zero.\n4. **Back-run:** Attacker immediately calls `exitRushPool` to withdraw their stake, emptying the pool for the next opportunity.\n5. The attacker can repeat this process indefinitely, preventing legitimate users from ever staking, costing only the gas fees for the sandwich transactions.",
  "fix_description": "It is recommended to implement an anti-sandwich measure, such as a minimum stake duration or an unstaking delay, to increase the cost and reduce the profitability of this DOS attack.",

  "finding_description": "The `takeFee()` function is external and lacks any access control, allowing anyone to call it for any user's debt. This function executes fee calculation and share reduction via `_takeFee`. An external actor can selectively and repeatedly call this function for targeted depositors, gradually decreasing their shares and, in effect, increasing the proportional ownership of depositors whose fees have not been taken.",
  "attack_scenario": "1. Depositors A, B, and C hold equal shares. \n2. An attacker calls `takeFee()` targeting only Depositor A and B's debt/shares, causing their share balances to slightly decrease due to the fee subtraction.\n3. Depositor C's shares remain unchanged.\n4. This selective fee application causes C's proportional claim on the underlying assets to increase at the expense of A and B, enabling a griefing or subtle profit redistribution attack that is detrimental to the targeted users.",
  "fix_description": "Consider limiting the function to a protected role (e.g., `onlyKeeper`, `onlyOwner`) and/or modifying the function to only allow a user to call `takeFee` for their own position, e.g., by adding a check that `user == msg.sender`.",
